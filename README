The gincltex Package
Copyright (C) 2011 -- Martin Scharrer <martin@scharrer-online.de>

Version v0.1 -- 2011/03/06

This small package builds on the standard LaTeX packages graphic
and/or graphicx and allows external LaTeX source files to be included like
graphic files, i.e. adds support for the `.tex' extension.

    \includegraphics[<options>]{somefile.tex}

Some of the lower level operations like clipping and trimming are implemented
using the pgf package which supports both DVI/PS and PDF output. This package
uses a very similar technique than the author's other package adjustbox, but
provides a different interface.
